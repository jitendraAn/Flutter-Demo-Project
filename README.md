# my_flutter_cocktail_app

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.deAns- Stateless Widget:
Stateless Widgets are static widgets.
They do not depend on any data change or any behavior change.
Stateless Widgets do not have a state, they will be rendered once and will not update themselves, but will only be updated when external data changes.
For Example: Text, Icon, RaisedButton are Stateless Widgets. 
 
Stateful Widget:
Stateful Widgets are dynamic widgets.
They can be updated during runtime based on user action or data change.
Stateful Widgets have an internal state and can re-render if the input data changes or if Widget’s state changes.
For Example: Checkbox, Radio Button, Slider are Stateful Widgetsv/docs/get-started/codelab)
